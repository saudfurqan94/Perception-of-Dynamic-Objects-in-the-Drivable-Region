Lane Detection using Image Processing: Applied Canny edge detection, Hough Transform, and semantic segmentation to detect lane boundaries from camera images.

Object Detection using Deep Learning: Used a pre-trained neural network (e.g., YOLO, SSD) to detect vehicles and pedestrians, applying bounding box regression and non-maximum suppression (NMS) for accurate localization.
